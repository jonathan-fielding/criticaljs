CriticalJS is a JavaScript library which enables you to improve the perceived performance of your site.

## Getting setup

The simplest way to use CriticalJS is to include the critical.js file in your page and then specify a data attribute with the location of the main JavaScript that is to be defered.

```
<script src="criticaljs.min.js" data-deferredjs="main.js"></script>
```
